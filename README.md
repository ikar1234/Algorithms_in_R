# Algorithms in R and Python
I implemented a plenty of algorithms in R and Python:

* Burrows-Wheeler Transform and exact search in BWT
* Cartesian tree of a sequence of integers
** Linear time construnction of a Suffix tree from the Cartesian tree 
* Lyndon factorization from Suffix array [[1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jda.2014.06.001)]
* Skew algorithm for suffix arrays
